WHAT IS MLH INIT?
INIT is a celebration for the start of the 2022 Hackathon Season! While this is the first time we are running INIT, the format will feel familiar to those who have participated in Local Hack Day. You can expect to complete challenges, hear about BIG community announcements, chat at hacker hangouts, enjoy fun live sessions, and make new memories (and memes).
